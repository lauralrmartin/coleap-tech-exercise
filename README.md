# Coleap technical test
This is my implementation of Coleap's technical test in under 2h.

## Mock API
```
https://6157228e8f7ea600179850e4.mockapi.io/api/vehicles
```

## Exercise
- Read the data from the API provided above
- Display the items in a grid with photo, make, model and price
- Add sorting to the grid to sort by: price and range
- When clicking on an item, a modal opens up and displays the rest of the information: available colours, price, range

## Stack

This project is built using `TypeScript` and `NextJS`. I've used `Tailwind CSS` to speed things up and little to no custom CSS.

- [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/docs): React based framwork
- [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/docs): Minimal CSS framework

## How to run
You can run the project locally with `npm install` and `npm run dev`. With a few tweaks it could be easily deployed to production too.
